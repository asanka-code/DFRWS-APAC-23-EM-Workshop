# DFRWS APAC 2023 Workshop: 
## Forensic Insights from Electromagnetic Radiation

### Introduction
Our digital electronics generate electromagnetic radiation. These radiation patterns are shown to be correlating with the internal operations of electronics circuitry. Electromagnetic side-channel analysis (EM-SCA) is the field that exploits electromagnetic radiation emitted from computing devices to exfiltrate sensitive information. EM-SCA can take us to places where the classical digital forensics approaches cannot go. This workshop is aimed at providing the foundation into the exciting field of EM-SCA for digital forensics, arming the participants with the required skills and directions to go deep into this field. During this half-day workshop, the participants will be exposed to the software-defined radio equipment that can be used to acquire electromagnetic radiation, i.e., HackRF SDRs, and the procedure to capture, process, and analyse electromagnetic radiation from a diverse set of devices-under-test (DUT) — including IoT devices and smartphones — to extract forensically-useful insights.
